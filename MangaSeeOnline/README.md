# MangaSeeOnline-Reader
A small userscript, which shows the picture in fullscreen and removes bloat from www.mangaseeonline.us

# Resizing
The script checks every 0.25 seconds, if the natural imagesize has changed. If it has changed the Script will resize the image to fit the browser height and width

# Usage
I have written the script for Tamermonkey in Chrome. I don't intend to test it an any other browser. If there are issues let me know and i will look into it :-)

## Step 1
Download Tampermonkey Chrome extension
## Step 2
Click on the icon and choose "Add new script"
## Step 3
Copy the whole "MangaSeeOnline Script.user.js" and paste it in there
## Step4
Save and have fun!

# Bugs
If you find something that seems wrong let me know!
