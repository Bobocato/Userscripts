# Amazonvideo Scripts
These are my Amazonvideo userscripts.

## Skip Preroll Ad and Outro
Clicks the Button to skip the preroll ad and the "Next Episode" button for you.

## Speed
Saves the Playbackspeed and applies it to the videos. Because of the way Amazonvideo loads the videos there is only an increase of 0.1 per time possible.
