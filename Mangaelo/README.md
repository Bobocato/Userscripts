# Mangaelo declutter and shortcuts
Userscript which add keyboard shortcuts and cleans mangaelo.com.

# Cleaning
Removes the header and the footer

# Shortcuts
Use the left and right arrowkeys to navigate between chapters

# Autonext
When the page is scrolled to its bottom the script automatically loads the next chapter.
If you scroll up again the timer will be deleted.
You can disable this with the field "autoload" on top of the document. Just set it from ´true´ to ´false´.

# Usage
I have written the script for Tamermonkey in Chrome. I don't intend to test it an any other browser. If there are issues let me know and i will look into it :-)

## Step 1
Download Tampermonkey Chrome extension
## Step 2
Click on the file on github
## Step 3
Click on the button that says "raw" at the top of the page.
## Step 4
You will be shown a mask in which you can install the script.
## Step 5
Save and have fun!
