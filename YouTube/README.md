# YouTube Scripts
These are my YouTube userscripts there are written for the current version of YouTube.

## Remove Watched Videos
This will check the subfeed and remove watched videos.

## Automatically Skip Adds
This will skip the ad before video as soon as the 5 second mark is passed.
I am from germany and my youtube is in german. 
If you are from a diffrent country you have to change the const "equalText" to the text that is shown after the "wait 5 seconds to skip the add" banner. !!!CASE MATTERS!!!  

## Usage
I have written the script for Tamermonkey in Chrome. I don't intend to test it an any other browser. If there are issues let me know and i will look into it :-)
